## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the GenMaster AI Studio running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10 or newer.
-   API key from [Stability AI](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys).
-   API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
-   (Optional) A [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account for payment processing.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/genmaster-ai-studio.git
cd genmaster-ai-studio
```

### Step 2: Create Folders for Assets

Create the necessary directories for images and UI icons.

```bash
# This command works on macOS, Linux, and modern Windows PowerShell
mkdir -p docs/images ui_icons
```
Place your screenshot files in the `docs/images` folder.

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

The project's dependencies are listed below. Install them all using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" customtkinter Pillow python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] python-multipart requests
```

<details>
<summary><code>requirements.txt</code></summary>

```text
# FastAPI and Web Server
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]

# GUI Framework
customtkinter
Pillow

# Authentication and Security
python-jose[cryptography]
passlib[bcrypt]
python-multipart

# API Client
requests
```
</details>

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

For the application to connect to the AI services, you must provide your API keys. The best way to do this is with an environment file.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2.  Copy the content below into your new `.env` file.
3.  Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys and secrets.

<details>
<summary><code>.env</code> file content</summary>

```dotenv
# ===============================================
# GenMaster AI Studio - Environment Configuration
# ===============================================
#
# This file stores your secret keys and configuration.
# Do not share this file or commit it to version control.
#

# --- AI API Keys ---
# Get your API key from https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys
STABILITY_API_KEY="YOUR_STABILITY_AI_API_KEY_HERE"

# Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

# --- Security (IMPORTANT) ---
# Replace this with a long, random, and secret string.
# You can generate one using: python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'
SECRET_KEY="a_very_secret_key_for_jwt_v3_change_me_now"

# --- Stripe Configuration (Optional) ---
# These are required only if you want to test the payment functionality.
# Get these keys from your Stripe Dashboard (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
# This is the signing secret for your webhook endpoint.
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_YOUR_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
# Get this by creating a new configuration at https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal
STRIPE_CUSTOMER_PORTAL_LINK="YOUR_STRIPE_CUSTOMER_PORTAL_CONFIG_LINK_HERE"
```
</details>

### Step 6: Download UI Icons

The application looks for icons in the `ui_icons` directory you created earlier. You will need to add the necessary `.png` icon files. You can find suitable icons from sources like [Google Fonts Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

-   Download and place the following icons (or equivalents) inside the `ui_icons` folder:
    -   `palette_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.png` (for 'generate')
    -   `photo_library_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.png` (for 'gallery')
    -   ... and all other icons referenced in the script.

### Step 7: Run the Application

Execute the main Python script. This will automatically start the FastAPI backend server and launch the CustomTkinter GUI.

```bash
python your_main_script_name.py
```

The terminal will show logs from the Uvicorn server, and the desktop application window will appear. You can now register a new user and start generating images!

## üìÇ Project Structure and Version Control

The project creates several files and directories during operation. It is crucial to prevent sensitive information and generated content from being committed to version control.

### Files to Ignore

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your project with the following content. This will ensure that your environment file, database, generated images, and other temporary files are not tracked by Git.

<details>
<summary><code>.gitignore</code></summary>

```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual environment
/venv/
/.venv/
/env/
/ENV/
/virtualenv/

# Database
*.db
*.sqlite3

# Environment variables
.env

# Generated Content
/generated_images_v3/
/user_uploads_v3/

# IDE and OS specific
.idea/
.vscode/
.DS_Store
```
</details>
